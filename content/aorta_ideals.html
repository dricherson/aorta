        Our event strives to promote and support personal growth by honoring the individual diversity within each of us and celebrating those differences.  We give freely of ourselves without expectation in order to embrace the here and now.  We honor ourselves and others by donating our time, our art, and our support to each other.

        In the spirit of self sufficiency our event shys away from market independence and corporate sponsorships. Asking instead that members bring all that they need to sustain themselves, and that we leave the land better than it was found through strict leave no trace policies.
